## README
- A simple calculator build using Vue (and Vuex)
- To test, run **`npm install`** & **`npm run build-dev`**
- This Vuex version is definitely over-kill for such a small app, but this was done more as a learning exercise
- [This version](https://github.com/ramraphael/calculator-vue-vanilla) was also built in Vue, but without the boilerplate of the Vuex version

## Stretch features I didn't have time for
- Dynamic font-size for the display to handle the overflow
- **`bigInts`** (using a third party library) to handle number overflow
- A more accurate font choice
- Global Light/dark theme
- Functioning window buttons =D
- Scientific calculator extension
